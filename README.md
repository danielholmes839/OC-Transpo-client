This is the React.js client using my [OC Transpo GraphQL API](https://github.com/danielholmes839/OCTranspo-GraphQL). stop-checker.com is the fastest way to access live bus data and schedules from OC Transpo (Ottawa's public transit system). Quickly get a map showing the location of your bus in real time. It's free and easy to use!
